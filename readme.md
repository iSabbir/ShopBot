| WEBHOOK_PATH              | The path to the webhook where Telegram servers send requests for bot updates. It is not recommended to change it if only one bot will be deployed.

| WEBAPP_PORT               | Port for Telegram bot, if you plan to deploy several bots on the same server, you will need to assign a different port to each one (Not relevant to the multibot case).                                                                                                                                                     | No recommended value                                                |

### 1.1 Starting AiogramShopBot with Docker-compose.

* Clone the project from the master branch.<br>``git clone git@github.com:ilyarolf/AiogramShopBot.git``
* If you want to use the version with database encryption, clone from the feature/sqlalchemy-sqlcipher
  branch.<br>``git clone git@github.com:ilyarolf/AiogramShopBot.git -b feature/sqlalchemy-sqlcipher``
* Set environment variables in docker-compose.yml file, token from @BotFather(``TOKEN``), token from
  ngrok(``NGROK_TOKEN``), telegram id of admins(``ADMIN_ID_LIST``), support link (``SUPPORT_LINK``, the link will be
  needed for the "Help" button in the bot).
* If you use the version with database encryption, you must set a variable with the password from the
  database (``DB_PASS``).
* Run the ``docker-compose up`` command.

> **Note**
> **<br>To get the ngrok token, you need to register on the ngrok website and confirm your email. Then you will have the
ngrok token in your personal account.**

### 1.2 Starting AiogramShopBot without SQLCipher database encryption.

> **Note**
> **<br>Fully compatible with python 3.9.6.<br>AiogramShopBot from the master branch does not use database encryption
via SQLCipher, but it does use Aiosqlite**

* Clone the project from the master branch. ``git clone git@github.com:ilyarolf/AiogramShopBot.git``
* Install all necessary packages ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Set the environment variables to run in the .env file.<br>Example:

```
WEBHOOK_PATH = "/bot"
WEBAPP_HOST = "localhost"
WEBAPP_PORT = 1234
TOKEN = "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
ADMIN_ID_LIST = 123456,654321
SUPPORT_LINK = "https://t.me/your_username_123"
DB_NAME = "db_file_name.db"
NGROK_TOKEN = "NGROK_TOKEN_HERE"
PAGE_ENTRIES = 8
BOT_LANGUAGE = "en"
MULTIBOT = "false"
```

* After these steps the bot is ready to run, the entry point to run the bot is run.py ```python run.py```

### 1.3 Starting AiogramShopBot with SQLCipher database encryption.

> **Note**
> **<br>To run AiogramShopBot with database encryption via SQLCipher, it is recommended to use Linux kernel operating
systems because installing SQLCipher on Windows is not the easiest.**

* Clone the project from the feature/sqlalchemy-sqlcipher
  branch.<br>``git clone git@github.com:ilyarolf/AiogramShopBot.git -b feature/sqlalchemy-sqlcipher``
* Install the SQLCipher package, for example in Ubuntu this can be done with the command ``sudo apt install sqlcipher``.
* Install all necessary packages ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Variables in .env are set in the same way as in point 1.1, but with one exception, you need to set a password for the
  database.<br>Example:

```
WEBHOOK_PATH = "/bot"
WEBAPP_HOST = "localhost"
WEBAPP_PORT = 1234
TOKEN = "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
ADMIN_ID_LIST = 123456,654321
SUPPORT_LINK = "https://t.me/your_username_123"
DB_NAME = "db_file_name.db"
DB_PASS = "your_password_to_database"
NGROK_TOKEN = "NGROK_TOKEN_HERE"
PAGE_ENTRIES = 8
BOT_LANGUAGE = "en"
MULTIBOT = "false"
```

* After these steps the bot is ready to run, the entry point to run the bot is run.py ```python run.py```

## 2.AiogramShopBot User's Manual

### 2.1 Registration

User registration occurs when the bot is first accessed with the ``/start`` command. Each user is assigned a different
mnemonic phrase to generate BTC, LTC, USDT TRC20 crypto addresses. BTC and LTC addresses are generated according to
BIP-84 standard, for USDT TRC20 the BIP-44 standard is used, this is done so that wallets can be easily imported into
Trust Wallet.

### 2.2 Top-up balance

To deposit balance in the bot, go to "My Profile -> Top Up balance". Copy the address of the cryptocurrency you want to
top up and send the cryptocurrency there, then go back to "My Profile" and click "Refresh Balance". Refreshing the
balance takes some time (1-2 seconds).
